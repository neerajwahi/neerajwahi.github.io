Operational transformation (OT) is a really cool algorithm for conflict-free editing of a shared document. It was popularized by [Google Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wave) and later integrated into Google Docs.

In this series of posts I'll share what I learned about the algorithm while building a collaborative code editor ([pairjam.com](http://pairjam.com))

Note: this is both a long boring series and mostly a rehash of [an excellent article](http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/understanding-and-applying-operational-transformation) by Daniel Spiewak.

## Motivation

Suppose we have two users who are concurrently editing the following shared document:

> abcd

This document is drier than an old gluestick, but it'll demonstrate all of the core concepts.

There are two parts to operational transformation:

- The actual transforms
- The control strategy
