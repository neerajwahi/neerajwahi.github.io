Welcome!

In this blog I will post my thoughts for mostly nobody to read.

Most posts will be mildly technical and touch on areas of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

Goals for this blog:

- Explain cool problems, algorithms and data structures that I come across in a clear and casual way.

- Clarify my own understanding of topics by trying to explain them (dual of the above goal).
